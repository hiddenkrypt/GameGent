# GameGent
DMG-01 emulator

Written in C(18)
Built with Code::Blocks -- http://www.codeblocks.org/

Using SDL2.0 -- https://www.libsdl.org/

Maybe using tiny file dialogs -- https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/

Mainly building this as a personal project because I've always wanted to make an emulator. My goals are to make the end program user-friendly for non-technical people, so I'm avoiding any sort of command line interface.

I've made and am sticking to [my own styleguide](Styleguide.md) for this as I haven't found any other styleguides for C that I quite like. I still need to figure out a linter that I can configure to my style, though.
