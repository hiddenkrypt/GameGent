DMG-01 emulator

Written in C(99)
Built with Code::Blocks -- http://www.codeblocks.org/

Using SDL2.0 -- https://www.libsdl.org/
Using tiny file dialogs -- https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/

Mainly building this as a personal project because I've always wanted to make an emulator. My goals are to make the end program user-friendly for non-technical people, so I'm avoiding any sort of command line interface.
